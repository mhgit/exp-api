## Installation and Setup

For detailed installation and setup instructions, please refer to the [Setup Guide](docs/SETUP.md) in the docs folder.
This guide includes:

- Step-by-step installation instructions
- Configuration details
- Keycloak setup and usage
- Authentication information
- Test user credentials

The setup process involves:

1. Cloning the repository and setting up the Gradle wrapper
2. Configuring the application using HOCON configuration files
3. Setting up Keycloak using the provided scripts:
    - `./scripts/start-keycloak.sh` - Starts the Keycloak server
    - `./scripts/setup-keycloak-realm.sh` - Configures the realm and resources
    - `./scripts/stop-keycloak-server.sh` - Stops the Keycloak server

## Architecture

The application follows a clean architecture pattern with distinct layers:

```mermaid
graph TD
    R[Routes]
    DTO[DTOs]
    M[Mappers]
    DM[Domain Models]
    RI[Repository Interfaces]
    RE[Repository Implementations]
    E[Entities]
    DB[(Database)]
    KC[(Keycloak)]
    Auth[Authentication Middleware]

    R --> DTO
    DTO --> M
    M --> DM
    DM --> RI
    RI --> RE
    RE --> E
    E --> DB

    Auth --> KC
    R --> Auth

    end

    subgraph Domain\ Layer
        DM
        RI
    end

    subgraph Infrastructure\ Layer
        RE
        E
        DB
        KC
    end

    style Presentation\ Layer fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px
    style Domain\ Layer fill:#bbf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px
    style Infrastructure\ Layer fill:#bfb,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px
```


### Layer Responsibilities

- **Presentation Layer**
  - Routes: Handle HTTP requests and responses
  - DTOs: Data Transfer Objects for API requests/responses
  - Mappers: Convert between DTOs and Domain Models

- **Domain Layer**
  - Domain Models: Core business entities
  - Repository Interfaces: Define data access contracts

- **Infrastructure Layer**
  - Repository Implementations: Concrete data access logic
  - Entities: Database model representations
  - Database: Actual data storage

### Data Flow

1. HTTP Request â†’ Route
2. Route receives DTO
3. Mapper converts DTO to Domain Model
4. Domain Layer processes business logic
5. Repository Interface defines data access
6. Repository Implementation handles persistence
7. Entity maps to database structure
8. Response flows back through the layers

This architecture ensures:
- Separation of concerns
- Domain logic isolation
- Infrastructure independence
- Testability
- Maintainability

## Authentication with Keycloak

The application uses Keycloak for authentication and user management. Below is a diagram showing how API calls are
intercepted and routed through Keycloak:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant API as Eagle Bank API
    participant Auth as Authentication Middleware
    participant Protected as Protected Endpoints
    participant KC as Keycloak Server

    Client->>KC: 1. Authenticate (username/password)
    KC-->>Client: 2. Return JWT token
    Client->>API: 3. API request with JWT token
    API->>Auth: 4. Intercept request
    Auth->>KC: 5. Validate token (using JWK)
    KC-->>Auth: 6. Token validation result

    alt Valid Token
        Auth->>Protected: 7a. Route to protected endpoint
        Protected-->>Client: 8a. Return response
    else Invalid Token
        Auth-->>Client: 7b. Return 401 Unauthorized
    end
```

### Why Keycloak?

There are several advantages to using Keycloak over implementing custom authentication:

1. **Centralized Identity Management** - Single source of truth for user identities across multiple applications
2. **Industry-Standard Security** - Implements OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect protocols
3. **Rich Feature Set** - User federation, social login, multi-factor authentication, and more
4. **Reduced Development Effort** - No need to implement complex security features from scratch
5. **Delegation of Security Concerns** - Security experts maintain Keycloak, reducing the risk of security
   vulnerabilities

### Role-Based Access Control for Preventing IDOR Attacks

Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) are a type of access control vulnerability that occurs when an application uses
user-supplied input to access objects directly. Keycloak's role-based access control can be leveraged to prevent IDOR
attacks in the following ways:

#### User List Access Restriction

A common IDOR vulnerability is allowing regular users to access a complete list of all users in the system:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant RegularUser as Regular User
    participant API as Eagle Bank API
    participant KC as Keycloak

    RegularUser->>API: GET /v1/users
    API->>KC: Check if user has 'admin' role

    alt Has Admin Role
        KC-->>API: Role verification success
        API-->>RegularUser: Return complete user list
    else No Admin Role
        KC-->>API: Role verification failure
        API-->>RegularUser: Return 403 Forbidden
    end
```

Implementation approach:

1. Define an 'admin' role in Keycloak
2. Assign this role to administrative users only
3. In the API endpoints that return lists of users, check for the 'admin' role in the JWT token
4. Return a 403 Forbidden error if the user doesn't have the required role

#### Account Access Restriction

When implementing account management features, it's critical to prevent users from accessing other users' accounts:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User as User
    participant API as Eagle Bank API
    participant KC as Keycloak

    User->>API: GET /v1/accounts/{accountId}
    API->>KC: Extract user ID from token
    API->>API: Verify account belongs to user

    alt Account Belongs to User
        API-->>User: Return account details
    else Account Doesn't Belong to User
        API-->>User: Return 403 Forbidden
    end
```

Implementation approach:

1. Store account ownership information in the database (which user owns which account)
2. Extract the user ID from the Keycloak JWT token for each request
3. Before returning account information, verify that the account belongs to the requesting user
4. For administrative functions, create specific roles (e.g., 'account-manager') that allow access to multiple accounts
5. Always log access attempts for security auditing

By implementing these role-based access controls with Keycloak, the application can effectively prevent IDOR
vulnerabilities and ensure that users can only access resources they are authorized to view or modify.
